# Welcome to Apartmate!

## Getting Started

To run Apartmate on your local machine, go ahead and fork and clone the backend and frontend repo from github. Then install the dependencies needed for both sides by running ```npm i ``` in your terminal. 
Then create a .env to keep your REACT_APP_SERVER_URL, JWT_SECRET and MONGO_URI.

In order to run the backend repo, you need to input ```nodemon``` in the backend terminal and for the client/frontend repo, you need to run ```npm start```. 

# About Our Project 

We started out with a basic idea of how we wanted Apartmate to look like and like any ideas, we knew it would change as we went on but wanted to stick to the original wireframe.
